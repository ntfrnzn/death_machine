## FoxReplace and "gun" substitution

### What

This is an exported FoxReplace configuration file that will allow your browser to replace the word _gun_ with the words _death machine_.  There are related substitutions as well

## How

To use it, first use [*FireFox*](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).   You know how to do that. Then, install the *FoxReplace* add-on.  To do that, Run the browser, look at the _Tools_ menu for the _Add-ons_, and select it.  _Search_ for  "foxreplace" and install it, restarting *FireFox* as necessary.  

Navigate again to the _Addons_ menu, and click the _Import from URL_ button.  Paste in:  

Make sure to check the _Auto-replace on page load_ button if you want it to load automatically.  Should be good to go now. Navigate to pages run by your friends at http://nra.org to see what it looks like.

## Why

Well, you know. 

In mid 2015, it occurred to me that the world needed a browser substitution plugin for these words. Because they are synonyms. I looked around, realized that *FoxReplace* already did everything I would want, and just needed some configuration, so I wrote a few rules for it.  And then let it drop.  

Today, I think maybe it's worth posting and sharing.  

## What else?

It needs capitalization fixes.  If it's a great idea, then perhaps it should work for other browsers?  I don't know.  Give me some feedback, make a pull request?  If you think this is worthwhile I'll be inspired  to at least make the capitalization fixes.
